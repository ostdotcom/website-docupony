OST stands for "Open Simple Token". OST aims to be the blockchain technology partner of choice for businesses of all sizes and levels of technical sophistication, enabling any business to create, launch, and manage their own branded digital token economy powered by OpenST protocols and OST blockchain management software. Our signature product, [<u>OST KIT⍺</u>](https://kit.ost.com), enables you to launch your own Branded Tokens backed by OST⍺ (also referred to as "$OST⍺").

OST KIT⍺ is built on the OpenST protocol. The OpenST protocol allows for the staking of $OST⍺ on Ropsten Ethereum that enables Branded Tokens to be created, or "minted" on the OpenST network of sidechains. You can learn more about the OpenST Protocol [<u>here</u>](https://openst.org).

OST KIT⍺ provides you with tools for designing, planning, minting, and managing your branded token economy. With our recent release of OST KIT⍺, along with other features, developers will be able to do the following with APIs: 

* [<u>Setup transaction types</u>](api_actions_create.html) for your Branded Token that are user-to-user, company-to-user, and user-to-company
* [<u>Define transactions in fiat value</u>](api_actions_create.html) that use the OST Price Oracle to automatically adjust the price of your Branded Token
* [<u>Enable your company to collect fees</u>](api_actions_create.html) for certain transactions
* [<u>Create Users</u>](api_users_create.html) 
* [<u>Airdrop</u>](api_airdrop_drop.html) Branded Tokens to selected users
* [<u>Execute transactions</u>](api_transaction-types_execute.html)
