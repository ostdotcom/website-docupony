OST KIT⍺ in its current release is not yet feature complete. This release is for early user testing. It does the ground work to help create a toolkit that meets the real needs of real businesses.

OST KIT⍺ is a SaaS (software as a service) designed for both business people and developers. Anyone will be able to use OST KIT⍺ to design, create and manage their token economy, setup transactions and users, mint their tokens, simulate transactions, and more, without requiring them to have blockchain developers in-house.

For developers, OST KIT⍺ offers a robust set of APIs so that developers can integrate OST KIT⍺ into their existing apps and run operations on their own.

### Key features in OST KIT⍺ include:
* Design & Plan your Branded Token Economy 
* Choose your token name, token symbol, and icon
* Use our Token Economy Planner to set the value of your token and to decide how many tokens to mint
* Define action types you want people to earn and spend your token on, such as user-to-user, company-to-user and user-to-company
* Setup users and airdrop tokens to selected users
* Mint your tokens
* Simulate and execute transactions 
* Monitor and manage your token economy
* View the actual API calls behind programmable actions at various points and access robust developer APIs
