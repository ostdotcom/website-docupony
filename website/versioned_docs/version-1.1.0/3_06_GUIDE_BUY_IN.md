While OST KIT is in Alpha, all of our token economies are operated on Ropsten testnet. Therefore, OSTÎ±, the base token needed for running your token economy, has no real-world value. However, in order to have a fully functioning token economy i.e. one that incorporates Buy-Spend-Earn dynamics from users, you'll need to enable users to buy-in to your economy. This guide walks you through the process of integrating a payment processor (we use Stripe as an example) with your App and using a combination of their APIs and ours to simulate "buying" of Branded Tokens while we are on the testnet.
