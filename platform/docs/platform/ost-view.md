OST VIEW is the block explorer for viewing Brand Token transactions and contracts on the OST blockchains. You can toggle between OST Platform Sandbox (testnet) and Production (mainnet) views.

A multi-chain explorer, OST VIEW is a search engine and browser that people can utilize to view human-readable block, transaction, and account information on the OST blockchains.

OST VIEW provides individual and aggregate historical data, including statistics and charts, on Brand Token transfers in, and across OST-powered Brand Token economies.

On Testnet the ticker OSTT indicates the token OST-Test which is a test version of the OST Token used in the OST Sandbox environment.
