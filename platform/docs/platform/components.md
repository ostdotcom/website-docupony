The diagram above illustrates how the OST Server Side SDK and OST Wallet SDK work together and interact with your technology.

OST APIs and Server Side SDKs make it simple and easy for developers to integrate brand tokens into their apps. The SDKs provide various methods and URLs for different services like users, tokens, transactions, wallet services corresponding to an end-user of the economy.

These SDKs are designed so that the server side components can support different approaches. They will be used for server to server interactions and they will be paired with the relevant wallet SDK. They can also be paired with your web application.

OST Wallet SDK enables users to transact with Brand Tokens from within your mobile app, without requiring them to directly manage their private crypto keys. This involves private key management, authorization and recovery services in addition to authentication.

The OST Platform is built on OpenST Protocol. The protocol enables the creation of BTs and allows BT economies to scale to billions of transactions. You can learn more about the OpenST Protocol at Github/OpenST
