OST Platform is a complete technology solution enabling businesses to easily launch blockchain-based economies without requiring blockchain development. Developers can use OST Platform to create, test and launch Brand Tokens backed by value tokens such as the OST Token.

OST Platform is the first full-featured “no-code” blockchain platform — a set of unified dashboards, APIs, SDKs, wallets, and protocols that any business can use to easily deploy their own brand currency without requiring any in-house blockchain development.

The diagram below illustrates how the different integration components of OST Platform work together and interact with your technology.

OST APIs and Server Side SDKs make it simple and easy for developers to integrate brand tokens into their apps. The SDKs provide various methods and URLs for different services like users, tokens, transactions, wallet services corresponding to an end-user of the economy.

These SDKs are designed so that the server side components can support different approaches. They will be used for server to server interactions and they will be paired with the relevant wallet SDK. They can also be paired with your web application.

OST Wallet SDK enables users to transact with Brand Tokens from within your mobile app, without requiring them to directly manage their private crypto keys. This involves private key management, authorization and recovery services in addition to authentication.

The OST Platform is built on OpenST Protocol. The protocol enables the creation of BTs and allows BT economies to scale to billions of transactions. You can learn more about the OpenST Protocol at Github/OpenST
