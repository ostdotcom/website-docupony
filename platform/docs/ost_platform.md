## Introduction
OST Platform is a complete technology solution enabling businesses to easily launch blockchain-based economies without requiring blockchain development. Developers can use OST Platform to create, test and launch Brand Tokens backed by value tokens such as the OST Token.

OST Platform is the first full-featured “no-code” blockchain platform — a set of unified dashboards, APIs, SDKs, wallets, and protocols that any business can use to easily deploy their own brand currency without requiring any in-house blockchain development.

## Platform Components

The diagram above illustrates how the OST Server Side SDK and OST Wallet SDK work together and interact with your technology.

## SDKs
### Server Side SDKs 

* Server Side SDKs will allow developers to create users in your economy, perform company-to-user transactions and register wallet devices (mobile devices) on OST Platform.
* Server Side SDK sample codes are available on [API References](/platform/docs/api) page. Server Side SDKs are available in [PHP](/platform/docs/sdk/server_sdk_setup/php/), [Ruby](/platform/docs/sdk/server_sdk_setup/ruby/), [Java](/platform/docs/sdk/server_sdk_setup/java/) and [Node.js](/platform/docs/sdk/server_sdk_setup/nodejs/)
* You can choose to use API directly if the Server Side SDK is not available for your choice of programming language.

### Mobile Wallet SDKs
    
* Wallet SDK enables users to transact with Brand Tokens within your mobile app, without requiring them to manage their private crypto keys. 
* Wallet SDK provides private key management, authorization and recovery services in addition to authentication.
