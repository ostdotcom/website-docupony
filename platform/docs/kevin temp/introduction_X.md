OST Platform provides everything you need to create, integrate, test and deploy brand tokens. Brand tokens are created by staking value tokens (such as the OST token or USDC token) on Ethereum mainnet and deploying them on scalable OST side-chains on Ethereum. 

Brand tokens are ideal for micro-transactions and open up a whole new world of customer engagement and monetization. The possibilities are endless and we hope look forward to seeing new and creative use cases unfold.

Our documentation is designed to give an overview of OST Platform and how it all fits together. _It is a non-technical view of things._

Our Server Side sdk and mobile Wallet sdk together enable fast and painless integration into any app, without requiring in-house blockchain expertise -- so you can focus on your business and leave the blockchain bits to us.




### 1. API and Server Side sdk:  

* Server Side sdk will allow developers to create users in your economy, perform company-to-user transactions and register wallet devices (mobile devices) on OST Platform.
* Server Side SDK sample codes are available on [API References](/platform/docs/api) page. Server Side sdk are available in [PHP](/platform/sdkserver_sdk_setup/php/), [Ruby](/platform/sdkserver_sdk_setup/ruby/), [Java](/platform/sdkserver_sdk_setup/java/) and [Node.js](/platform/sdkserver_sdk_setup/nodejs/)
* You can choose to use API directly if the Server Side SDK is not available for your choice of programming language.


### 2. Wallet SDK:
    
* Wallet SDK enables users to transact with Brand Tokens within your mobile app, without requiring them to manage their private crypto keys. 
* Wallet SDK provides private key management, authorization and recovery services in addition to authentication.



The OST Platform is built on OpenST Protocol. The protocol enables the creation of BTs and allows BT economies to scale to billions of transactions. You can learn more about the OpenST Protocol at [OpenST.org](https://openst.org/).
