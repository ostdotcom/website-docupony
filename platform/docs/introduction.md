## What is OST Platform?

![KitIndexImage]( /platform/docs/assets/getting-started/intro.png)

OST Platform provides everything you need to test, integrate, and deploy your brand currency. Our Server Side SDKs and Wallet SDKs together enable fast and painless integration into any app, without requiring any in-house blockchain expertise -- so you can focus on your business and leave the blockchain bits to us.

OST Platform enables businesses to easily integrate Brand Tokens into their apps to reward behaviors and increase engagement. OST Platform is the first full-featured “no-code” blockchain platform — a set of unified dashboards, APIs, SDKs, and protocols that any business can use to easily test and deploy their own brand currency without requiring any in-house blockchain development.

OST is designed for internet-grade transaction volumes and speeds. OST leads development of the OpenST Protocol for launching Brand Token economies for mainstream businesses and OpenST Mosaic, a scaling solution for finalizing many thousands of transactions per second asynchronously on Ethereum at low cost.

OST Platform enables you to embed value into any user action — be it an upvote, a like, a content contribution, a 5 star review, a store visit, or a repeat purchase.

We call this “programmable money” and it’s a really big deal. In the current Internet, payments (and money changing hands) comes only at the very end of the user journey. Now, with programmable money, value transfers can happen at any point throughout the user journey, triggered by action. This opens up new models for user engagement, content creation, revenue sharing, and monetization .

The OST Platform is built on OpenST Protocol. The protocol enables the creation of BTs and allows BT economies to scale to billions of transactions. You can learn more about the OpenST Protocol at [OpenST.org](https://openst.org/).

OST Platform is a complete technology solution enabling businesses to easily launch blockchain-based economies without requiring blockchain development. Developers can use OST Platform to create, test and launch Brand Tokens backed by value tokens such as the OST Token.

## "Brand Tokens" Explained
At the core of OST is the concept of OST-powered Brand Tokens (BTs). BTs are white-label cryptocurrency tokens running on highly-scalable OST sidechains, supported by staking value tokens (such as the OST Token) on Ethereum mainnet. This enables companies to deploy BTs that function like rewards points, which can be deployed to incentivize and reward users and to drive growth and retention.

You can easily setup your Brand Tokens in the OST Platform SaaS dashboards before turning to the Developer Resources to work on your integration.
