:::note OST Server Side SDKs
**OST Server Side SDKs** are designed so that server side components can support different approaches. The SDKs will be used for server to server interactions and will be paired with the relevant Wallet SDK. They can also be paired with your web application.

The SDKs provide various methods and URLs for different services like `users`, `tokens`, `transactions`, and wallet services corresponding to an end-user.

**OST Wallet SDKs** enables users to transact with Tokens from within your mobile app, without requiring them to directly manage their private crypto keys. This involves private key management, authorization and recovery services in addition to authentication.
