:::

## a. Access your API and WebHook keys and secrets
Log-in to OST Platform and go to the **Developers** tab. There you can find your API and Webhook keys and secrets. You need to confirm your email address before getting access.

:::note API Requests
Every API request has 4 mandatory parameters that must be included: 
* `api_key`: the API key as provided from developers page inside OST Platform dashboard.
* `api_request_timestamp`: the current unix timestamp in seconds.
* `api_signature`: the signature as the sha256 digest of the shared API secret and the correctly formatted query string as described below.
* `api_signature_kind`: the value for this parameter should be OST1-HMAC-SHA256.

## b. Review technical guides
Check-out our technical implementation guides for an overview of how to approach the integration, best practices, and tips. You can find these in the main menu on the left.

## c. Decide which APIs/SDKs to use

### Server Side SDKs
* [PHP](/platform/docs/sdk/server-side-sdks/php/)
* [Ruby](/platform/docs/sdk/server-side-sdks/ruby/)
* [Java](/platform/docs/sdk/server-side-sdks/java/)
* [Node.js](/platform/docs/sdk/server-side-sdks/nodejs/)

### Mobile Wallet SDKs
* [Android](/platform/docs/sdk/mobile-wallet-sdks/android/) 
* [iOS](/platform/docs/sdk/mobile-wallet-sdks/iOS)
* [React Native](/platform/docs/sdk/mobile-wallet-sdks/react-native)

## d. Perform test transactions
Perform test transactions in Sandbox to ensure everything is working as expected! Check our [Go-Live Checklist](/platform/docs/go-live-checklist/) for a list of things to consider.

:::tip user_ID Map
When you integrate Tokens into your application, please remember to:
 * Create and maintain a map of OST Platform user_id to the user's profile on their app
 * [Generate and safely store a 30 character "secret" for each user](/platform/docs/guides/create-user-wallet/#generate-passphaseprefix). This "secret" is used for the recovery and thus must be unique to each user.

## e. Finalise development and design (Step 2)
After you have conducted tests in Sandbox and have a better feel for the finalise these steps before moving to Step 4
* **Token name and identifier** (in Production, does not need to match Sandbox)
* **What to stake** and how much to stake to being with
* **Conversion rate:** Token to underlying stake / value token
* **Mobile and web UX and design and implementation**
