Stake and Mint is the process of first **staking** a value token on Ethereum mainnet and then using that stake to **mint** your Brand Tokens. Your Brand Tokens are backed by what is staked. This gives them value and differentiates them from traditional rewards points.

You can distribute tokens to your end users through company-to-user transactions. To kick-start an economy and incentivise new users, companies often airdrop tokens to users after they activate their wallet.

:::important 
If you build a product  or solution that requires third parties to purchase tokens from you, those tokens can be distributed through traditional means e.g. like a prepaid phone card, sold online.
