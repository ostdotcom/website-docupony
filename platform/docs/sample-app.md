title: A Sample App Built With OST Platform APIs/SDKs
sidebar_label: Sample App
---

We have built and released a sample app to showcase what's possible with OST Platform. The sample app is available on both Android and iOS and is built using the [OST Wallet React-Native SDK](/platform/docs/sdk/mobile-wallet-sdks/react-native/).

**Motivations for building the Sample App**
1. Showcase what's possible with OST Platform
2. Make it simple for anyone to experience token transactions
3. Make it simple for developers to understand the wallet features and how they can be incorporated into their own apps

## Experiment with the Sample App
There are two ways to access and download the sample app (also known as the OST Wallet App). 

:::note Switch Tokens 
If you get invited to use another token in the app and want to flip back to a previous one, you can do this by referring to the invitation email you received and either clicking on the 'Claim Tokens' button or by scanning the QR code in the email from within the app, on the login page.
:::

### 1. Claim POP Tokens
The first approach is the most straight forward ⁠— just submit your email address on our [Homepage](https://ost.com). You will receive an email with links to download the app and a button to 'Claim Tokens'. The button links to our Popcorn (POP) Token which we created to allow anyone to experience the app without first having to create their own token.

### 2. Create Your Own Token
The second approach is to create you own token and to add that to the sample app. Creating a token is straight forward and can be done via OST Platform. You will first need to register for a free account on [OST Platform](https://platform.ost.com/sign-up).

The steps to create your and mint tokens is detailed in our [Create Token Guide](/platform/docs/1-create/).

**Add Your Token to OST Wallet App**<br>
After you have minted some tokens, you will be able to add your token to the sample app with just one click. You will receive an email with links to download the app and a button to 'Claim Tokens'. The button, in this instance, will link to your Token. 

Follow the steps and screenshots [here](/platform/docs/wallet/app/#add-your-token-to-ost-wallet-app).

:::note Invite Colleagues To Transact With
When you create your own token and add it to the sample app, you will be the only token holder to begin with. To transact with others, invite them to join you in the sample app! You can invite others from within OST Platform, on the Wallet page.
