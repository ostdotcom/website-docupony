## Improvements

* **Webhook**
    * You can now use webhooks to subscribe to event notifications in OST Platform. A list of events (also called as topics in OST Platform) is available here: [Webhook Topics](https://dev.ost.com/platform/docs/api/#webhook-topics).

* **Multiple Pay Currency**
    * Price Point gives you the conversion rates between `base currency` and `pay currency`. Two new `pay currencies` have been added in this release which are `EUR` and `GBP`. 


### SDK and API changes

* **API**
    * Ability to create, read, list, update and delete a webhook.
    * API response if [GET Price Point](/platform/docs/api/#get-price-point-information) is updated to include more pay currencies (`EUR` and `GBP`).

* **Server SDK**
    * Ability to create, read, list, update and delete a webhook.
    * Version updated to `2.2.0`.
