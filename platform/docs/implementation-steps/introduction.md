## "Tokens" Explained
At the core of OST Platform is the concept of Tokens. Tokens are value-backed tokens created on Etherum and running on scalable side-chains. Tokens serve as a medium of exchange and can be used to power all sorts of actions, increase user retention and drive growth.

:::note Tokens Have Real-Value
Tokens are created by first staking real-value on Ethereum and using that as a basis to mint new tokens. The value of a Token is directly linked to the value of the underlying stake.
