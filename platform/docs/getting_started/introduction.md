OST Platform provides everything you need to test, integrate, and deploy your brand currency. Our Server Side SDKs and Wallet SDKs together enable fast and painless integration into any app, without requiring any in-house blockchain expertise -- so you can focus on your business and leave the blockchain bits to us.

At the core of OST is the concept of OST-powered Brand Tokens (BTs). BTs are white-label cryptocurrency tokens running on highly-scalable OST sidechains, backed by staking value tokens (such as the OST Token) on Ethereum mainnet. This enables companies to deploy BTs that function like rewards points, which can be deployed to incentivize and reward users and to drive growth and retention. 



## OST Platform Components

![platform-interaction](/platform/docs/assets/Platform-Integrations.jpg)
The diagram above illustrates how the server SDK and Wallet SDK work together and interact with your technology.


### 1. API and Server Side SDKs:  

* Server Side SDk will allow developers to create users in your economy, perform company-to-user transactions and register wallet devices (mobile devices) on OST Platform.
* Server Side SDK sample codes are available on [API reference](/platform/docs/api) page. Server Side SDKs are available in [PHP](/platform/docs/sdk/server_sdk_setup/php/), [Ruby](/platform/docs/sdk/server_sdk_setup/ruby/), [Java](/platform/docs/sdk/server_sdk_setup/java/) and [Node.js](/platform/docs/sdk/server_sdk_setup/nodejs/)
* You can choose to use API directly if the Server Side SDK is not available for your choice of programming language.


### 2. Wallet SDK:
    
* It enables users to transact with Brand Tokens within your mobile app, without requiring them to directly manage their private crypto keys. 
* Wallet SDK provides private key management, authorization and recovery services in addition to authentication.



The OST Platform is built on OpenST Protocol. The protocol enables the creation of BTs and allows BT economies to scale to billions of transactions. You can learn more about the OpenST Protocol at [OpenST.org](https://openst.org/).
