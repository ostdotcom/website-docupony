OST Platform provides everything you need to create, integrate, test and deploy brand tokens. Brand tokens are created by first staking a value token (such as the OST token or USDC token) on Ethereum mainnet and then deploying the value backed brand tokens on scalable [OpenST](https://openst.org/) side-chains on Ethereum.

**Brand tokens on OST side-chains are ideal for micro-transactions** and open up a whole new world of customer engagement and monetization. The possibilities are endless and we look forward to seeing new and creative use cases in action!

> This documentation is designed to give an indepth overview of OST Platform and how it all fits together. Sitting alongside our docs are our API References and SDKs which provide everything you need to know to integrate with OST Platform.
