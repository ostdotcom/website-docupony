OST stands for "Open Simple Token". OST platform has been designed to enable consumer internet businesses to integrate blockchain based tokens into their applications without requiring any in-house blockchain development. 

The OST platform consists of three main components:

* Infrastructure for scaling blockchain economies to millions of users and billions of transactions.
* APIs , SDKs and Development tools for easy integration and deployment.
* Wallet solution to facilitate end-user adoption.

The [Platform Overview](/platform/docs/getting_started/platform_overview/) page outlines the different components that are involved to integrate the OST solution. It also provides the different authentication approaches that are support in these different components.

## Motivations
* We believe developers love creating things, even more so when those things **provide value** in form of blockchain tokens **to your end-users.** 
* The OST suite of products makes it **easy** for you to **test the new blockchain technology**, create a **customer-centric brand token economy** and attain sustainable competitive advantage.
* A well structured brand token economy provides many ways for customers to earn and spend their Tokens within the companyâ€™s economy.  This helps you **achieve organic growth** by incentivizing users for doing meaningful actions within your economy.
