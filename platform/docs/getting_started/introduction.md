OST Platform provides everything you need to test, integrate, and deploy your brand currency. Our APIs, SDKs, and dashboards enable fast and painless integration into any app, without requiring any in-house blockchain expertise -- so you can focus on your business and leave the blockchain bits to us.

At the core of OST is the concept of OST-powered Brand Tokens (BTs). BTs are white-label cryptocurrency tokens running on highly-scalable OST sidechains, backed by staking value tokens (such as the OST Token) on Ethereum mainnet. This enables companies to deploy BTs that function like rewards points, which can be deployed to incentivize and reward users and to drive growth and retention. 

Use our robust RESTful APIs and SDKs to integrate your Brand Token into your applications with ease while observing the highest security standards. OST Platform makes it simple to test and deploy your brand currency without requiring in-house blockchain developers.

## OST Technology Stack

The OST technology stack is designed to give businesses everything they need to create, test, and deploy BTs. It consists of three main components:

* Infrastructure and protocols for efficiently scaling blockchain economies to millions of users and billions of transactions, at low cost.
* APIs, SDKs and Development tools for easy integration and deployment.
* Wallet solutions to facilitate end-user adoption while adhering to high security standards.

The [Platform Overview](/platform/docs/getting_started/platform_overview/) section outlines the different tools that are available to integrate the OST solution. It also provides the different authentication approaches that are supported in these different components.

## Motivations
* OST technology is helping innovative companies design the future of brand loyalty. We're thrilled to partner with the world's most progressive companies to re-imagine customer relationships.
* We want to make it as easy as possible for developers to integrate blockchain technology into their apps, to help unleash a new wave of customer-centric innovation.
* The OST Platform makes it easy for you to incorporate blockchain-based Brand Tokens into your app, create a customer-centric brand token economy, and attain sustainable competitive advantage.
