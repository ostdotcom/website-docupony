OST is a complete technology solution enabling mainstream businesses to easily launch blockchain-based economies without requiring blockchain development.

At the core of OST is the concept of OST-powered **Brand Tokens** (BTs).  BTs are white-label cryptocurrency tokens with utility representations running on highly-scalable Ethereum-based side blockchains, backed by OST tokens staked on Ethereum mainnet. Within a businessâ€™s token economy, BTs can only be transferred to whitelisted user addresses. This ensures that they stay within the token economy.

The **OST technology stack** is designed to give businesses everything they need to integrate, test, and deploy BTs. Within the OST suite of products developers can use **OST Platform** to create, test and launch Brand Tokens backed by OST.  OST Platform also provides dashboards that give insights into how the token economy is functioning. 


**OST APIs and Server Side SDKs** make it simple and easy for developers to integrate blockchain tokens into their apps. 

**Wallet SDK** provides for a seamless user experience within your app allowing users to own their tokens without requiring them to directly manage their private crypto keys. 

This whole suite is build on OpenST Protocol. The protocol enables the creation of BTs and allows BT economies to scale to billions of transactions. You can learn more about the OpenST Protocol at [OpenST.org](https://openst.org/).


## Developer Resources
A number of platform-specific SDKs are available to integrate OST APIs and wallet SDK into your applications. These SDKs provide a safe and secure way to quickly implement token economy within your app. 

The following SDKs are actively maintained and supported:

* [PHP](/platform/docs/server_sdk_setup/php/)  for server-side applications
* [Ruby](https://github.com/ostdotcom/ost-sdk-ruby) for server-side applications
* [Node](https://github.com/ostdotcom/ost-sdk-js).js for server-side applications
* [Java](https://github.com/ostdotcom/ost-sdk-java) for server-side applications

For Wallet integration, we provide wallet SDKs for iOS and Android applications.

* [iOS Wallet SDK](/platform/docs/wallet_sdk_setup/iOS/)
* [Android Wallet SDK](/platform/docs/wallet_sdk_setup/android/)


### Advantages
Using the OST SDKs provides a number of advantages

* **Simplicity**: The SDKs reduce the complexity of integration by handling multiple authentication scenarios automatically. This means that the appropriate method call will be to minimize the end-user interactions.
* **Performance**: Caching, key management and nonce management ensure that end-users overall experience is improved.
* **Security:** Separating the Server Side API interactions from the client ensures that user's private keys are generated and stored securely on the user's device and not shared across the network.


### Usage

The OST Platform Server Side SDKs are designed so that the server side components can support different approaches. They will be used for server to server interactions and they will be paired with the relevant wallet SDK. They can also be paired with your web application.

The diagram below illustrates this approach.

* The OST Platform Server Side SDKs and APIs provide your application with various methods and URLs for different services like users, tokens, wallet services corresponding to an end-user of the economy. 


* Wallet SDK adds support for users to own their tokens without requiring them to directly manage their private crypto keys. This essentially means providing private key management, authorization and recovery services in addition to authentication.


### Authentication Methods

| Authentication | Description |
|---|---|
| HMAC : hash-based message authentication. | Every API request on OST Platform API Endpoint requires hash-based message authentication. You can obtain your API key and shared API secret for your brand token from the OST Platform [Developers page](https://patform.ost.com/testnet/developer) <br><br> When using the Server Side SDKs authentication is handled for you. In other languages you have to  implement the signature generation by computing the HMAC sha256 digest of the API secret. You can find the details of the authentication process here. <LINK TO AUTHENTICATION DOC>   |
| Personal Signing  |**Wallet SDK** provides secure authentication by signing of data from user's mobile device. The SDK ensures a high level of privacy and trust, since the private keys with which it signs data never have to leave the mobile device. You can find the details of the authentication process here. **Client Side SDK authentication DOC**|
| Smartphone application | Within partner company's native application where Partner company demands the user to authenticate before the user authorizes sessions or devices. |
