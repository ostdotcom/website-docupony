1. [Register on OST Platform](https://platform.ost.com/sign-up) and get access to your [API key and API secret](https://platform.ost.com/developer). When you sign-up you will be in sandbox mode by default. It is recommended to test your integrations in sandbox mode.

2. Follow the quickstart guide to get started with Server Side SDK. Server Side SDK is available in [PHP](/platform/docs/sdk/server_sdk_setup/php/), [Ruby](/platform/docs/sdk/server_sdk_setup/ruby/), [Java](/platform/docs/sdk/server_sdk_setup/java/) and [Node.js](/platform/docs/sdk/server_sdk_setup/nodejs/). If Server Side SDK is not available in your choice of programming language then you can directly use [OST Platform API](/platform/docs/api).

3. Follow [Android Wallet SDK](/platform/docs/wallet_sdk_setup/android/) and/or [iOS Wallet SDK](;) setup guide to integrate it in your mobile application.
