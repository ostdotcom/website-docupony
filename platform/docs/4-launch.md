## a. Request to move to Production
To move from Sandbox to Production, click on the toggle switch in [OST Platform dashboard](https://platform.ost.com) and follow the instructions. At the moment, you are required to fill-out a Google Form.

:::note Sandbox
The Sandbox will still be available to you after you have been permitted to Production

## b. Conduct an initial pilot
We recommend a phased launch and launching to <10,000 users to begin with. This is to ensure that your Brand Token Economy performs as expected. 

## c. Fine-tune token economics
* Is the supply of Brand Tokens sufficient
* Are the actions and token _rewards_ right? Should token _rewards_ be more or less?

## d. Incorporate more use cases
Following an initial launch, you can rollout to additional customer segments and incorporate more use cases. If you would like to brainstorm on potential use cases, contact us at support@ost.com.

## e. Assess impact on KPIs e.g. NPS and Retention
* Are goals and objectives being met?
* Is your Brand Token having a material impact on customer engagement and satisfaction?
