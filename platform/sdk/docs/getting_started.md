Robust RESTful APIs and SDKs to integrate your Brand Token into your applications with ease while observing the highest security standards. The Server-Side APIs and SDKs provide various endpoints/methods that can be used by developers to design and manage their Brand Token Economies.

The OST Wallet SDKs enables end-users to comfortably and safely interact with Brand Tokens within existing mass-market mobile apps. Developers can integrate Brand Tokens into any app without encumbering the user experience, and take advantage of OST’s innovative wallet recovery methods.

Using OST Platform SDKs provides a number of advantages
Simplicity: The SDKs reduce the complexity of integration by handling multiple authentication scenarios automatically, allowing for a more seamless user experience.
Performance: Caching, key management and nonce management ensure that end-users’ overall experience is smooth.
Security: Separating the Server Side API interactions from the mobile wallet SDK ensures that private keys are generated and stored securely on the user’s device and not shared across the network.
