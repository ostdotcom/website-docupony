Robust RESTful APIs and SDKs to integrate your Brand Token into your applications with ease while observing the highest security standards. The Server-Side APIs and SDKs provide various endpoints/methods that can be used by developers to design and manage their Brand Token Economies.

The OST Wallet SDK enables end-users to interact with Brand Tokens within existing mass-market mobile apps. Developers can integrate Brand Tokens into any app without encumbering the user experience, and take advantage of OST’s innovative wallet recovery methods.

We provide Server Side SDKs mobile and Wallet SDKs to complete your integration. The OST Platform Server Side SDKs provide your application with various methods for different services like users, tokens, wallet services corresponding to an end-user of your economy. 

Server SDKs are available for  [PHP](/platform/docs/sdk/server-side-sdks/php/), [Ruby](/platform/docs/sdk/server-side-sdks/ruby/), [Java](/platform/docs/sdk/server-side-sdks/java/), [Node.js](/platform/docs/sdk/server-side-sdks/nodejs/).

**Using OST Platform SDKs provides a number of advantages**
1. **Simplicity:** The SDKs reduce the complexity of integration by handling multiple authentication scenarios automatically, allowing for a more seamless user experience.
2. **Performance:** Caching, key management and nonce management ensure that end-users’ overall experience is smooth.
3. **Security:** Separating the Server Side API interactions from the mobile wallet SDK ensures that private keys are generated and stored securely on the user’s device and not shared across the network.

The Wallet SDK adds support for users to own their tokens without requiring them to directly manage their private crypto keys. This essentially means providing private key management, authorization and recovery services in addition to authentication.
	
Wallet SDKs are available for [Android](https://github.com/ostdotcom/ost-client-android-sdk) and [iOS](https://github.com/ostdotcom/ost-client-ios-sdk). A [React Native Wallet SDK](/platform/docs/sdk/mobile-wallet-sdks/react-native/) is also available.
