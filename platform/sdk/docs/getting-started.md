Robust RESTful APIs and SDKs to integrate your Token into your applications with ease while observing the highest security standards and without encumbering the user experience. No in-house blockchain expertise required.

Server Side APIs and SDKs provide various endpoints/methods that can be used to design and manage Token Economies. Wallet SDKs enable end-users to interact with Tokens within existing mobile apps.

Server Side SDKs are available in 
* [PHP](/platform/docs/sdk/server-side-sdks/php/)
* [Ruby](/platform/docs/sdk/server-side-sdks/ruby/)
* [Java](/platform/docs/sdk/server-side-sdks/java/)
* [Node.js](/platform/docs/sdk/server-side-sdks/nodejs/)

**Using OST Platform SDKs has a number of advantages**
* **Simplicity** The SDKs reduce the complexity of integration by handling multiple authentication scenarios automatically, allowing for a more seamless user experience.
* **Performance** Caching, key management and nonce management ensure that end-users’ overall experience is smooth.
* **Security** Separating the Server Side API interactions from the Mobile Wallet SDK ensures that private keys are generated and stored securely on the user’s device and not shared across the network.

:::note User own their own Tokens
The Mobile Wallet SDK provides for users to <u>own</u> their Tokens without requiring them to directly manage their private crypto keys. This essentially means providing private key management, authorization and recovery services in addition to authentication.
