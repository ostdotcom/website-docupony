# Compliance Partner - [Acuris Risk Intelligence](https://www.acurisriskintelligence.com/) 

## Acuris Risk Intelligence Data
Acuris Risk Intelligence provides historic and global coverage on high-risk individuals and businesses allowing clients to pinpoint where risks may lie when beginning business relationships as well as the ability to track changes and alerts to those that they are monitoring.
With over 43,000 global sources of information, Acuris Risk Intelligence focuses on using only credible and official sources where the likes of Wikipedia, Social Media and blogs are completely avoided.
 
The profiles that Acuris Risk Intelligence provides have already undergone a “4-eyes” quality assurance process to eliminate unnecessary, non-actionable, irrelevant and duplicate articles which both reduces false positives and analysis time, but also allows clients to focus simply on those that are deemed high-risk according to international standards.
Acuris Risk Intelligence profiles allow a quick overview of high-risk businesses and individuals linked to the subject, with links being proven and shown as well as the ability to deep-dive into their profile.
 
Categorised articles make analysis more efficient, allowing a focus on specific types of information. For example, high-profile PEPs may have a high volume of PEP articles linked to them and 1 or 2 adverse media or law enforcement articles – the ability to see which articles are tagged in that type may mean the avoidance of reading tens of documents of which the information is already established.
