OST KYC enables its clients to easily verify the identity of their users. To do so OST KYC is using advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Facial Recognition (FR) technologies combined with matching algorithms to create fast and automatic ID verification process. 

During the KYC ID verification process the user is required to submit the following:

* Personal information (First name, Last name, DOB, Country etc.)
* Government issued ID document 
* Selfie image of the user holding the submitted ID document 

OST KYC is comparing all submitted information with the text from the submitted documents. It also makes sure there is a person in the selfie image and that this personâ€™s face matches the face in the ID image.
