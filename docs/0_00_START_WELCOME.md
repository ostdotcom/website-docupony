OST stands for "Open Simple Token". The OST software platform helps you gain competitive advantage with blockchain. Our signature product, [<u>OST KIT⍺</u>](https://kit.ost.com), enables you to launch your own Branded Tokens backed by OST⍺ (also referred to as "$OST⍺").

OST KIT⍺ is built on the OpenST protocol. The OpenST protocol allows for the staking of $OST⍺ on Ropsten Ethereum against minting branded tokens on the OpenST network of side blockchains. You can learn more about the OpenST Protocol [<u>here</u>](https://openst.org).

OST KIT⍺ provides you with tools for designing, planning, minting, and managing your branded token economy. With our recent release of OST KIT⍺, along with other features, developers will be able to do the following with APIs: 

* [<u>Setup transaction types</u>](2_06_API_TRANSACTION-TYPES_CREATE.md) for your Branded Token that are user-to-user, company-to-user, and user-to-company
* [<u>Define transactions in fiat value</u>](2_06_API_TRANSACTION-TYPES_CREATE.md) that use an OST Price Oracle to automatically adjust the price of your Branded Token
* [<u>Enable your company to collect fees</u>](2_06_API_TRANSACTION-TYPES_CREATE.md) for certain transactions
* [<u>Create Users</u>](2_01_API_USERS_CREATE.md) 
* [<u>Airdrop</u>](2_04_API_AIRDROP_DROP.md) Branded Tokens to selected users
* [<u>Execute transactions</u>](2_09_API_TRANSACTION-TYPES_EXECUTE.md)
