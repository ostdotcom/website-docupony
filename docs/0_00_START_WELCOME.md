OST stands for "Open Simple Token". The OST software platform helps you gain competitive advantage with blockchain. Our signature product, [<u>OST KIT</u>](https://kit.ost.com), enables you to launch your own Branded Tokens backed by OST.


OST KIT⍺ is built on OpenST protocol. The OpenST protocol allows for the staking of $OST on Ethereum mainnet against minting branded tokens on the OpenST network of side blockchains. You can learn more about the [<u>OpenST Protocol here.</u>](https://openst.org)
