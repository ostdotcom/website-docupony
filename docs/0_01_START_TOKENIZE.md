An important aspect while setting up a branded token economy is to list all core user actions in your application. Then filter the actions for which you want to trigger the branded token exchange.  For example "like," "share", "purchase" ,”download," "reward," "monthly winner" or "birthday event"  are actions/events that can be setup as transactions. Once you create such transactions in OST KITα and assign value to each of them, they become opportunities for your end-users to “Earn” and “Spend” your branded tokens. This exchange of tokens represents a token economy.

The first step towards starting a token economy is to set the conversion rate. The simplest way to set your conversion rate is to consider how much $USD you would like 1 of your Branded Tokens to initially be worth. Followed by creating transaction types and associating value to each transaction type. Once you've setup these you are ready to Mint your Branded Tokens on our side blockchains.


We want to enable you to easily and safely create your own Branded Token Economy on highly scalable OpenST Side Blockchains. These side blockchains are one of our key innovations. We use the OpenST technology protocol to create Branded Tokens on side blockchains by staking OST on the pubilic Ethereum blockchain.

OST KITα is a step towards providing you an ecosystem for designing, planning, minting, and managing a branded token economy backed by OST. Know more about OST KITα in next section.
