An important aspect while setting up a branded token economy is to list all core user actions in your application. Then filter the actions for which you want to trigger the branded token exchange.  For example "like," "share", "purchase" ,”download," "reward," "monthly winner" or "birthday event"  are actions/events that can be setup as transactions. Once you create such transactions in OST KITα and assign value to each of them, they become opportunities for your end-users to “Earn” and “Spend” your branded tokens. This exchange of tokens represents a token economy.

We want to enable you to easily and safely create your own Branded Tokens on highly scalable OpenST Side Blockchains. These side blockchains are one of our key innovations. We use the OpenST technology protocol to create Branded Tokens on side blockchains by staking OST on the pubilic Ethereum blockchain.

OST KITα is a step towards providing you an ecosystem for designing, planning, minting, and managing a branded token economy backed by OST. It starts with setting up a conversion rate for your Branded Token. You can then create as many transaction types as you like and you can name them as it best fits the economic drivers of your business. You can set value for each of these transactions. The transaction value represents how much it is worth each time one of your customers execute that transaction.  Thus working towards shaping your own branded token economy.
