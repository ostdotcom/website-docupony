We want to enable you to easily and safely create your own Branded Tokens on highly scalable OpenST Side Blockchains. These side blockchains are one of our key innovations. We use the OpenST technology protocol to create Branded Tokens on side blockchains by staking OST⍺ on the public Ropsten Ethereum blockchain. [<u>Learn more about the OpenST protocol</u>](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/openst-platform/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

OST KIT⍺ provides you tools to design, plan, mint, and manage a branded token economy backed by OST⍺.

It starts with setting up a conversion rate for your Branded Token. You can then create as many transaction types as you like to address the core user actions in your application and you can name them as it best fits the economic drivers of your business. For example, "like", "share", "purchase", "download", "reward", "monthly winner", or "birthday event" are actions/events that can be setup as transactions.

Once you create such transactions in OST KIT⍺ and assign value to each of them, they become opportunities for your end-users to earn and spend your branded tokens. The transaction value represents how much it is worth each time one of your customers executes that transaction. This exchange of tokens represents a token economy; defining transactions thus works towards shaping your branded token economy and tokenizing your application.
