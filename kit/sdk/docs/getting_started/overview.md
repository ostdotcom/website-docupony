## Concepts
We provide client and server SDKs to complete your integration :

* The KIT Server SDKs provide your application with various methods for different services like users, tokens, wallet services corresponding to an end-user of the economy. 

	Server SDK is available for  [PHP](https://github.com/ostdotcom/ost-sdk-php) 

* The Wallet SDK adds support for users to own their tokens without requiring them to directly manage their private crypto keys. This essentially means providing private key management, authorization and recovery services in addition to authentication.
	
	Wallet SDKs are available for [Android](https://github.com/ostdotcom/ost-client-android-sdk) and [iOS](https://github.com/ostdotcom/ost-client-ios-sdk)
